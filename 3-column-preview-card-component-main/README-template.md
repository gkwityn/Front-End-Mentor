## Overview

3-column preview card component solution for Frontend Mentor.  My main focus was to learn and implement a styling preprocessor (SASS).

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

## My process

My process was to ensure a mobile first approach but focus on keeping the CSS DRY.  Secondary focus was to implement as many SASS features as possible.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

# Sass Features Used:
--Variables 
--Nesting
--Partials
--Mixins
--Inheritance



```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Continued development

Review other developers solutions to get to as close to pixel perfect as possible.
May refactor.

### Useful resources

- [SASS Documentation](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/) - The offical SASS documentation was very helpful and clear getting up and running.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.example.com) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand XYZ. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
